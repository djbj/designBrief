            # Sprint 2 - The Design Brief

Today you will for the first time work on a real design brief, your goal for today is to please the designer by copying the design as close as you can.

Also, remember that designers are picky, we expect all distances, sizes, colors and fonts to be as in the brief.

## How to complete this assignment

You will complete this assignment when your version looks the same as the design brief for **desktop** (responsive design for this one is a stretch goal. See the stretch goals section for more details). We expect colors, fonts, sizes and differences to match as much as possible. If they are not specified, do your best to come as close as possible.

### Project setup

In the "code" folder in this assignment you'll find a copy of the Technigo React starter project which you can use as a base to complete this assignment. In the terminal, "cd" into that folder and install dependencies by running `npm install`. Once that's done, you can start the project by running `npm start`.

You can write the HTML for this assignment in app.js (code/src/components/app.js), and the CSS in code/src/index.css.

### Brief and Assets

In the `assets` folder (code/public/assets) are all image assets you need to complete this assignment. The font used in the design is can be added to the project using [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora?selection.family=Lora).

To complete this assignment, you need to fork this repository, add your code in the "code" folder, and then submit a pull request on GitHub (from your repository into the technigo one) for review. Read the guide on GitHub for more info on how to do this.

Good luck!

### :sos: How to get help
Learning how to think as a web developer is learning how to be an expert in problem solving. So whenever you get stuck start with step 1 and continue until problem solved.

1. Google! In English, type in the error message if there is one, search within the language you're using (ie CSS, JavaScript etc).
2. Ask your code buddies in your Company.
3. Ask your fellow students in Slack.
4. Ask Damien. Please note: we are part of a sharing community - share the answer with your fellows.

### :boom: Success!

After completing this assignment you should be comfortable setting up a React app and writing static JSX to build web pages. You should also be comfortable in compiling React code and viewing the result in your browser.
